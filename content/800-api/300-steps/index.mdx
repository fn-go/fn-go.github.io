# Steps

## `sh`

## `do`

## `parallel`

## `defer`

## `matrix`

## `return`

## `fn`

## `dyn`

The `dyn` step kind of like an `any` in Go. It allows you to decide what it is, and what it does at runtime. The way this works is by accepting JSON, which is first run through a templating.

# Shortcuts

Many steps can be shortcut represented in various forms, as you may have seen in the [Getting Started](/#flexible-nature) guide.
