# Templating

In addition to being able to do things using `shell` scripts and commands, `fn` also allows any string field to first to be interpreted as a `go txt/template` first.

    <AlertTitle>A note about escaping</AlertTitle>

    Use the following syntax to escape the Go txt/template mustache syntax:

    ```Go
    {{`{{ foo }}`}}
    ```

    Notice how we are encapsulating the actual value as a string literal inside the `{{ }}` block.
